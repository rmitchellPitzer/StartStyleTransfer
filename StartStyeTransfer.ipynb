    "# Hello!\n",
    "my name is Ryder Mitchell, I'm a third year Computer Science major at Pitzer, but majoring in Harvey Mudd's Computer Science major, and this is my final project called \"startStyleTransfer!\"\n",
    "# So what is this?\n",
    "startStyleTransfer performs what is called a \"style transfer\", the process of analyzing the details that define the style of one image, and using those details, blending them into another image, a content image.\n",
    "# Why?\n",
    "I wanted something I could show to people interested in the Computer Science major but might not have any experience in CS. Showing them what's fun and cool and interesting about doing CS may get them more interested in CS or programming. I felt that what may be interesting to me might not be well understood by others, as saying \"We trained a model to make predictions in a jupyter notebook\" or \"We disassembled a program and tried to retrieve passcodes contained in the cache\" would confuse people. Instead I wanted something interesting, engaging, and not too difficult to be into!"

    "Before we do that however, we'll need to go over how we're doing this. Different coding languages exist for different purposes. Some are good for work related tasks, others are good for beginners getting into coding, or others are just very confusing (looking at you JavaScript). What you're seeing in this notebook is Python, a common, easy to use coding language that many companies use due to it's general purpose nature. Chances are you've definitely used Python, unless you've never opened Instagram, listened to a song on Spotify, or called an Uber. Or used Google.\n",
    "The strength of Python lies within it's robust libraries, which are addons, kind of like packages, that can be added ontop of what you're writing your code to do to make it do extra stuff. Notice how the examples I listed all do very different things. If you need to visualize graphs and data, there's a library for that. Need to process images? There's a library for that. Need to have emojis in your program? There's a library for that too! Of course you don't need to add these packages to your programs if Python is perfectly capable of it, but the option to add more libraries is always there.\n",

Time allows us to keep track of time, pillow, or Python Imaging Library, allows us to add and process images, os and os.path means we can scan our filesystem, important for importing images, and ipywidgets gives us widgets within our jupyter notebook, like a user interface.
